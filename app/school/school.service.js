  // This part of the code will likely fail if dummy/default Branch/Grade IDs don't exist or are invalid.
  // It's better to make these fields non-mandatory for 'superadmin' role in User model.
  // Forcing a temporary workaround by omitting them and hoping mongoose allows it due to role or specific logic.
  // If User.create fails due to this, we'll need to revisit User model or get clarification.
